# Pentago
A two-player board game

Instructions:

To run the program, use the command python pentago.py

- Enter your moves as block/position blockDirection (e.g. 3/8 2r).
- Case does not matter.
- This will run with alpha-beta pruning as is.
- To run just minimax with no alpha-beta, uncomment line #417 and comment out #418. 
- Run with the same command.

Once you reach the end of a game, you can see game results in a file saved as gameresults.txt
